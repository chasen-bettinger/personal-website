                I am a former software developer turned product owner that loves
                to creatively solve problems. I value using the right tool for
                the job, identifying the root cause of why a problem might
                exist, and using to data and metrics to measure success. I
                believe in being customer obssessed, getting feedback quickly,
                and communicating early often with my teammates.

                I once made the decision to drive 10 hours through the night to
                attend a hackathon at Princeton University. At the event, I
                built an{" "}
                <a className={"primary-500 inline-link position-relative"}>
                  Alexa Voice App
                </a>{" "}
                that enabled a user to track their goals. Ever since, I've been
                hooked on building software as a means to solve for challenges
                we all face every day.

                When I'm not tinkering on something, you can find me cheering on
                the Montreal Canadiens, reading a book, or going to the gym.
