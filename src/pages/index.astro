      <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Chasen! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        I am a cloud-native software developer turned security engineer that
        loves to build products. I value using the right tool for the job,
        identifying the root cause of why a problem might exist, and using to
        data and metrics to measure success. I believe in being customer
        obssessed, getting feedback quickly, and communicating early and often
        with my teammates.

        I once made the decision to drive 10 hours through the night to attend a
        hackathon at Princeton University. At the event, I built an{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        that enabled a user to track their goals. Ever since, I've been hooked on
        building software as a means to solve for challenges we all face every day.

        When I'm not tinkering on something, you can find me cheering on the
        Montreal Canadiens, reading a book, or going to the gym.
